            In contrast, if you were to directly modify state, like state = initialState, it wouldn't
            work as expected because you cannot directly reassign state in reducers.
            State reassignment is not tracked by Immer, so it wouldn't result in the state actually changing.
            In a reducer, state = initialState does not work because:
            Redux reducers donâ€™t allow you to reassign the state parameter.
            You are working with a proxy object provided by Immer, so
            mutating that object is fine (e.g., state.user = null),
            but reassigning state itself will not work because you're not allowed to directly
            change the reference to the state object.
            Avoid reassigning state (e.g., state = initialState) because Redux reducers expect you
            to either mutate parts of the state or return a new state object.
